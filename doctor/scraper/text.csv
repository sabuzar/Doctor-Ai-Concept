"ENDURING VALUES OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
No greater opportunity, responsibility, or obligation can fall to the lot of a human being than to become a physician. In the care of the suffering, [the physician] needs technical skill, scientific knowledge, and human understanding. Tact, sympathy, and understanding are expected of the physician, for the patient is no mere collection of symptoms, signs, disordered functions, damaged organs, and disturbed emotions. [The patient] is human, fearful, and hopeful, seeking relief, help, and reassurance.
—Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 1950
The practice of medicine has changed in significant ways since the first edition of this book was published in 1950. The advent of molecular genetics, sophisticated new imaging techniques, robotics, and advances in bioinformatics and information technology have contributed to an explosion of scientific information that has changed fundamentally the way physicians define, diagnose, treat, and attempt to prevent disease. This growth of scientific knowledge continues to evolve at an accelerated pace.
The widespread use of electronic medical records and the Internet have altered the way physicians and other health care providers access and exchange information as a routine part of medical education and practice (Fig. 1-1). As today’s physicians strive to integrate an ever-expanding body of scientific knowledge into everyday practice, it is critically important to remember two key principles: first, the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and, when it occurs, to diagnose it early and provide effective treatment; and second, despite 70 years of scientific advances since the first edition of this text, a trusting relationship between physician and patient still lies at the heart of effective patient care.

THE SCIENCE AND ART OF MEDICINE
Deductive reasoning and applied technology form the foundation for the approach and solution to many clinical problems. Extraordinary advances in biochemistry, cell biology, immunology, and genomics, coupled with newly developed imaging techniques, provide a window into the most remote recesses of the body and allow access to the innermost parts of the cell. Revelations about the nature of genes and single cells have opened a portal for formulating a new molecular basis for the physiology of systems. Researchers are deciphering the complex mechanisms by which genes are regulated, and increasingly, physicians are learning how subtle changes in many different genes, acting in an integrative contextual way, can affect the function of cells and organisms. Clinicians have developed a new ..."
"GOALS AND APPROACHES TO PREVENTION
Prevention of acute and chronic diseases before their onset has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of excellent medical practice for centuries and is now used as a metric for highly functioning health care systems. The ultimate goal of preventive strategies is to avoid premature death. However, as longevity has increased dramatically worldwide over the last century (largely as a result of public health practices), increasing emphasis is placed on prevention for the purpose of preserving quality of life and extending the health span, not just the life span. Given that all patients will eventually die, the goal of prevention ultimately becomes compression of morbidity toward the end of the life span; that is, reduction of the amount of burden and time spent with disease prior to dying. As shown in Fig. 2-1, normative aging tends to involve a steady decline in the stock of health, with accelerating decline over time. Successful prevention offers the opportunity both to extend life and to extend healthy life, thus “squaring the curve” of health loss during aging.
FIGURE 2-1

Prevention strategies have been characterized as tertiary, secondary, primary, and primordial. Tertiary prevention requires rapid action to prevent imminent death in the setting of acute illness, such as through percutaneous coronary intervention in the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Secondary prevention strategies focus on avoiding the recurrence of disease and death in an individual who is already affected. For example, tamoxifen is recommended for women with surgically treated early-stage, estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, because it reduces the risk of recurrent breast cancer (including in the contralateral breast) and death. Primary prevention attempts to reduce the risk of incident disease among individuals with one or more risk factors. Treatment of elevated blood pressure in individuals who have not yet experienced cardiovascular disease represents one example of primary prevention that has proven effective in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease.
Primordial prevention is a more recent concept (first introduced in 1979) that focuses on prevention of the development of risk factors for disease, not just prevention of disease. Primordial prevention strategies emphasize upstream determinants of risk for chronic diseases, such as eating patterns, physical activity, and environmental and social determinants of health. It therefore encompasses medical treatment strategies for some individuals as well as a strong reliance on public health and social policy. It is increasingly clear that primordial prevention represents the ultimate means for reducing the burden of chronic ..."
"INTRODUCTION
Vaccines have been recognized as one of the top public health achievements of the twentieth century. Dramatic declines in the morbidity and mortality of vaccine-preventable diseases have been observed, and the contribution of vaccines to the elimination, control, and prevention of infectious disease cannot be overstated. However, opposition and hesitancy to vaccines exist and are not new. Vaccine hesitancy has existed since Edward Jenner introduced the first vaccine against smallpox in the eighteenth century. So why did the World Health Organization rank these attitudes as one of the ten greatest threats to public health in 2019? Are current opposition and hesitancy any different from what has been seen before? Many sociologists, public health experts, and health care providers (HCPs) argue yes. Recent social and cultural trends, combined with new communication formats, have converged to create a particularly potent form of hesitancy and what some have labeled a crisis of confidence. This crisis manifests as a lack of trust in specific vaccines, vaccine programs, researchers, HCPs, the health care system, pharmaceutical companies, academics, policymakers, governments, and authority in general. (See “Focus: COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,” below.)
The roots of modern vaccine hesitancy and opposition—defined as delay or rejection of vaccines in spite of availability—vary depending on the place and the population. For some individuals and communities, pseudoscience and false claims about the safety of existing vaccines (e.g., an unsupported link between measles vaccine and autism) have driven fears, increased hesitancy, and decreased acceptance. For others, real safety events, such as the association of narcolepsy with a specific pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix), have justified concerns. In a few locations (e.g., Ukraine, Pakistan), vaccine hesitancy is the result of failed health systems or even state failures. Finally, for some groups, including some fundamentalist religious groups and alternative-culture communities, vaccine hesitancy and opposition reflect exclusion from and rejection of mainstream society and allopathic health care and manifest as a deep distrust of these institutions and their HCPs. Although the genesis of modern vaccine hesitancy is multifactorial, its outcomes are uniform: a decrease in vaccine demand and uptake, a decrease in coverage by childhood and adult vaccines, and an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases, outbreaks, and epidemics of disease. Addressing this crisis and moving people from vaccine hesitancy and refusal to acceptance and active demand require intervention at multiple levels: the individual, the health system (including public health), and the state.
This chapter will define vaccine hesitancy and briefly describe its determinants and effects in North America (the United States and Canada). Physicians and other HCPs are well positioned to address the crisis of confidence many patients feel toward HCPs and the health care system. Studies demonstrate that an unambiguous, strong recommendation by trusted HCPs is most often the reason that patients, including those who are vaccine hesitant, choose to vaccinate. Strategies for counseling vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-resistant patients will be presented and examples of strong vaccine recommendations provided. Presenting strategies ..."
"INTRODUCTION
Practicing medicine at its core requires making decisions. What makes medical practice so difficult is not only the specialized technical knowledge required but also the intrinsic uncertainty that surrounds each decision. Mastering the technical aspects of medicine alone, unfortunately, does not ensure a mastery of the practice of medicine. Sir William Osler’s familiar quote “Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability” captures well this complex duality. Although the science of medicine is often taught as if the mechanisms of the human body operate with Newtonian predictability, every aspect of medical practice is infused with an element of irreducible uncertainty that the clinician ignores at her peril. Although deeply rooted in science, more than 100 years after the practice of medicine took its modern form, it remains at its core a craft, to which individual doctors bring varying levels of skill and understanding. With the exponential growth in medical literature and other technical information and an ever-increasing number of testing and treatment options, twenty-first century physicians who seek excellence in their craft must master a more diverse and complex set of skills than any of the generations that preceded them. This chapter provides an introduction to three of the pillars upon which the craft of modern medicine rests: (1) expertise in clinical reasoning (what it is and how it can be developed); (2) rational diagnostic test use and interpretation; and (3) integration of the best available research evidence with clinical judgment in the care of individual patients (evidence-based medicine [EBM]).
BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL REASONING
Clinical Expertise
Defining “clinical expertise” remains surprisingly difficult. Chess has an objective ranking system based on skill and performance criteria. Athletics, similarly, have ranking systems to distinguish novices from Olympians. But in medicine, after physicians complete training and pass the boards (or get recertified), no tests or benchmarks are used to identify those who have attained the highest levels of clinical performance. At each institution, there are often a few “elite” clinicians who are known for their “special problem-solving prowess” when particularly difficult or obscure cases have baffled everyone else. Yet despite their skill, even such master clinicians typically cannot explain their exact processes and methods, thereby limiting the acquisition and dissemination of the expertise used to achieve their impressive results. Furthermore, clinical virtuosity appears not to be generalizable, e.g., an expert on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be no better (and possibly worse) than a first-year medical resident at diagnosing and managing a patient with neutropenia, fever, and hypotension.
Broadly construed, clinical expertise encompasses not only cognitive dimensions involving the integration of disease knowledge with verbal and visual cues and test interpretation but also potentially the complex fine-motor skills necessary for invasive procedures and tests. In addition, “the complete package” of expertise in medicine requires effective communication and care coordination with patients and members of the medical team. ..."
"DISEASE NOSOLOGY AND PRECISION MEDICINE
Modern disease nosology arose in the late nineteenth century and represented a clear departure from the holistic, limited descriptions of disease dating to Galen. In this rubric, the definition of any disease is largely based on clinicopathologic observation. As the correlation between clinical signs and symptoms with pathoanatomy required autopsy material, diseases tended to be characterized by the end organ in which the primary syndrome was manifest and by late-stage presentations. Morgagni institutionalized this framework with the publication of De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis in 1761, in which he correlated the clinical features of patients with more than 600 autopsies at the University of Padua, demonstrating an anatomic basis for disease pathophysiology. Clinicopathologic observation served as the basis for inductive generalization coupled with the application of Occam’s razor in which disease complexity was reduced to its simplest possible form. While this approach to defining human disease has held sway for over a century and facilitated the conquest of many diseases previously considered incurable, overly inclusive and simplified Oslerian diagnostics suffer from significant shortcomings. These include, but are not limited to, failure to distinguish the underlying etiology of different diseases with common pathophenotypes. For example, many different diseases can cause end-stage kidney disease or heart failure. Over time, the classification of neurodegenerative disorders or lymphomas, as well as many other diseases, is becoming more refined and precise as the underlying etiologies are identified. These distinctions are important for providing predictable prognostic information for individual patients with even highly prevalent diseases. Additionally, therapies may be ineffective owing to a lack of understanding of the often subtle molecular complexities of specific disease drivers.
Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, the era of molecular medicine offered the idealized possibility of identifying the underlying molecular basis of every disease. Using a conventional reductionist paradigm, physician-scientists explored disease mechanism at ever-increasing molecular depth, seeking the single (or limited number of) molecular cause(s) of many human diseases. Yet, as effective as this now conventional scientific approach was at uncovering many disease mechanisms, the clinical manifestations of very few diseases could be explained on the basis of a single molecular mechanism. Even knowledge of the globin β chain mutation that causes sickle cell disease does not predict the many different manifestations of the disease (stroke syndrome, painful crises, and hemolytic crisis, among others). Clearly, the profession had expected too much from oversimplified reductionism and failed to take into consideration the extraordinary biologic variety and its accompanying molecular and genetic complexity that underpin both normal and pathologic diversity. The promise of the Human Genome Project provided new tools and approaches and unleashed efforts to identify a monogenic, oligogenic, or polygenic cause for every disease (allowing for environmental modulation). Yet, once again, disappointment reigned as the pool of genomes expanded without the expected revelations (aside from rare variants). The arc of progressive reductionism (as illustrated for tuberculosis in Fig. 5-1) in ..."
"INTRODUCTION
A primary goal of health care is to prevent disease or detect it early enough that intervention will be more effective. Tremendous progress has been made toward this goal over the past 50 years. Screening tests are available for many common diseases and encompass biochemical (e.g., cholesterol, glucose), physiologic (e.g., blood pressure, growth curves), radiologic (e.g., mammogram, bone densitometry), and cytologic (e.g., Pap smear) approaches. Effective preventive interventions have resulted in dramatic declines in mortality from many diseases, particularly infections. Preventive interventions include counseling about risk behaviors, vaccinations, medications, and, in some relatively uncommon settings, surgery. Preventive services (including screening tests, preventive interventions, and counseling) are different than other medical interventions because they are proactively administered to healthy individuals instead of in response to a symptom, sign, or diagnosis. Thus, the decision to recommend a screening test or preventive intervention requires a particularly high bar of evidence that testing and intervention are both practical and effective.
Because population-based screening and prevention strategies must be extremely low risk to have an acceptable benefit-to-harm ratio, the ability to target individuals who are more likely to develop disease could enable the application of a wider set of potential approaches and increase efficiency. Currently, there are many types of data that can predict disease incidence in an asymptomatic individual. Germline genomic data have received the most attention to date, at least in part because mutations in high-penetrance genes have clear implications for preventive care (Chap. 467). Women with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, the two major breast cancer susceptibility genes identified to date, have a markedly increased risk (five- to twentyfold) of breast and ovarian cancer. Screening and prevention recommendations include prophylactic oophorectomy and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both of which are considered to incur too much harm for women at average cancer risk. Some women with BRCA mutations opt for prophylactic mastectomy to dramatically reduce their breast cancer risk. Although the proportion of common disease explained by high-penetrance genes appears to be relatively small (5–10% of most diseases), mutations in rare, moderate-penetrance genes, and variants in low-penetrance genes, also contribute to the prediction of disease risk. Most recently, polygenic risk scores combining information about variants across hundreds of genes are being evaluated for identifying individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease and other conditions. The advent of affordable whole exome/whole genome sequencing is likely to speed the dissemination of these tests into clinical practice and may transform the delivery of preventive care.
Other forms of “omic” data also have the potential to provide important predictive information. Proteomics and metabolomics can provide insight into gene function, but it has proven challenging to develop reliable, predictive measures using these platforms. More recently, it has become possible to measure the presence of mutations in DNA circulating in the bloodstream and in stool, with early promising evidence that these assays can be used to detect cancer before ..."
"INTRODUCTION
Health care systems are highly complex organizations, with many interdependent components. In developed countries, health systems have traditionally been classified by their type of financing—i.e., either predominantly tax-funded (such as the National Health Service in England and publicly operated regional care systems in the four European Nordic countries) or predominantly statutory social health insurance (SHI)-funded (such as in Germany, the Netherlands, and France). Over the past several decades, however, there has been structural convergence in the technical characteristics of both funding arrangements and in the associated delivery systems, making analytic observations about differences across national systems more difficult.
A second confounding factor has been that former Soviet Bloc countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, have, since 1991, replaced their former Soviet-style Semashko models (a top-down, national government–controlled funding and delivery structure with a parallel Communist Party administrative apparatus) with various hybrid arrangements built on national government–run SHI financing. Distinctions across developed country health systems, especially in Europe, have been further compressed by inadequate resources in many publicly funded systems in an era of rapid clinical and technological change, triggering increased private sector funding and provision.
In middle-income developing countries, institutional structures in the health sector typically reflect the country’s preindependence administrative framework. Mexico, for example, has a Spanish-derived configuration with health insurance as part of social insurance for formally employed workers (via Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social), supplemented by tax-funded health services (Seguro Popular) provided for those with informal employment and all other citizens, as well as a separate program (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado) for public employees. Countries such as India and Egypt, reflecting British influence, have predominantly tax-funded and publicly operated health systems. China is an exception, with an internally generated system that is publicly funded and operated, although recent Communist Party policy has been to introduce SHI-based insurance with individual medical savings accounts (patterned after Singapore), promote private insurance, and expand private hospitals.
In lower-income developing countries, health services are typically provided by tax-funded public institutions, often with considerable inadequacies and sometimes with substantial copayments. It is important to note that governmentally organized systems in nearly all developing countries, as well as in former Soviet bloc countries and, to a lesser degree, in tax-funded developed countries, are supplemented to varying extents by a mix of private and/or employer-paid insurers and providers.
This chapter focuses on the individual patient care system: on the financing and delivery of individual clinical and preventive services. The individual patient care system is composed of the financing and delivery of necessary services to prevent death or serious harm (“rule of rescue”); to maintain quality of life; and to manage, reduce, and/or prevent the burden of illness on individual patients. While the technical dimensions of most clinical services are similar across countries, their organizational, social, and economic characteristics range widely. Health systems in ..."
"INTRODUCTION
Safety and quality are two of the central dimensions of health care. In recent years, it has become easier to measure safety and quality, and it is increasingly clear that performance in both dimensions could be much better. The public is—with good justification—demanding measurement and accountability, and payment for services will increasingly be based on performance in these areas. Thus, physicians must learn about these two domains, how they can be improved, and the relative strengths and limitations of the current ability to measure them.
Safety and quality are closely related but do not completely overlap. The Institute of Medicine has suggested in a seminal series of reports that safety is the first part of quality and that the health care system must first and foremost guarantee that it will deliver safe care, although quality is also pivotal. In the end, it is likely that more net clinical benefit will be derived from improving quality than from improving safety, though both are important and safety is in many ways more tangible to the public. The first section of this chapter will address issues relating to the safety of care and the second will cover quality of care.
SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE
Safety Theory and Systems Theory
Safety theory clearly points out that individuals make errors all the time. Think of driving home from the hospital: you intend to stop and pick up a quart of milk on the way home but find yourself entering your driveway without realizing how you got there. Everybody uses low-level, semiautomatic behavior for many activities in daily life; this kind of error is called a slip. Slips occur often during care delivery—e.g., when people intend to write an order but forget because they must complete another action first. Mistakes, by contrast, are errors of a higher level; they occur in new or nonstereotypic situations in which conscious decisions are being made. An example would be dosing of a medication with which a physician is not familiar. The strategies used to prevent slips and mistakes are often different.
Systems theory suggests that most accidents occur as the result of a series of small failures that happen to line up in an individual instance so that an accident can occur (Fig. 8-1). It also suggests that most individuals in an industry such as health care are trying to do the right thing (e.g., deliver safe care) and that most accidents thus result from defects in systems. Systems should be designed both to make errors less likely and to identify those that do inevitably occur.

"INTRODUCTION
Diagnosing patients’ illnesses is the essence of medicine. Patients present to doctors seeking an answer to the question, “What is wrong with me?” Ideally, no clinician would want to treat a patient without knowing the diagnosis or, worse yet, erroneously treat a misdiagnosed illness. From the earliest moments of medical school, the defining quest toward becoming a knowledgeable and proficient physician is learning how to put a diagnostic label on patients’ symptoms and physical findings, and clinicians pride themselves on being “good diagnosticians.” Yet the centuries-old paradigm of mastering a long list of diseases, understanding their pathophysiology, and knowing the cardinal ways they manifest themselves in signs and symptoms, while still of fundamental importance, is being challenged by new insights illuminated by the glaring spotlight of diagnostic errors. Basic internal medicine diseases, such as asthma, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, seizures, strokes, ruptured aneurysms, depression, and cancer, are misdiagnosed at shockingly high rates, often with 20–50% of patients either being mislabeled as having these conditions (false-positive diagnoses) or having their diagnosis missed or delayed (false negatives). How and why do physicians so often get it wrong, and what can we do to both diagnose and treat the problem of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis?
Diagnosis is both an ancient art and a modern science. The current science of diagnosis, however, goes far beyond what typically comes to clinicians’ and patients’ minds when they conjure up images of state-of-the-art molecular, genetic, or imaging technologies. Improvements in diagnosis are just as likely to come from other areas, many with origins outside of medicine, as they are from advanced diagnostic testing modalities. These diverse sciences that the field of diagnostic safety has, and must, draw from include systems and human factors engineering, reliability science, cognitive psychology, decision sciences, forensic science, clinical epidemiology, health services research, decision analysis, network medicine, learning health systems theory, medical sociology, team dynamics and communication, risk assessment and communication, information and knowledge management, and health information technology, especially artificial intelligence and clinical decision support. A clinician reading this chapter is likely to find this list of overlapping and intersecting domains quite daunting. However, rather than feeling overwhelmed, we urge readers to view them as the basic science supports that will ultimately make their lives easier and diagnosis more accurate and timely. Rather than feeling intimidated, clinicians should feel a sense of relief and assurance in understanding that good diagnosis does not rest entirely on their shoulders. Instead, it is a systems property, where an infrastructure and a team, one that especially includes the patient, can in a coordinated way work together to achieve more reliable and optimal diagnosis.
EMERGENCE OF DIAGNOSIS ERROR AS AN IMPORTANT PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE
Over the past decade, a series of studies culminating in a landmark report from the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM), Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, have shone a spotlight on diagnostic ..."
"INTRODUCTION
Over the course of its history, the United States has experienced dramatic improvements in overall health and life expectancy, largely as a result of initiatives in public health, health promotion, disease prevention, and chronic care management. Our ability to prevent, detect, and treat diseases in their early stages has allowed us to target and reduce rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite interventions that have improved the overall health of the majority of Americans, racial and ethnic minorities (blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans/Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders) have benefited less from these advances than whites and have suffered poorer health outcomes from many major diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. These disparities highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing the multiple factors that impact health outcomes, including structural racism, social determinants of health (SDOH), access to care, and health care quality. On this last point, research has revealed that minorities may receive less care and lower-quality care than whites, even when confounders such as stage of presentation, comorbidities, and health insurance are controlled. These differences in quality are called racial and ethnic disparities in health care. These health care disparities have taken on greater importance with the significant transformation of the U.S. health care system and value-based purchasing. The shift toward creating financial incentives and disincentives to achieve quality goals makes focusing on those who receive lower-quality care more important than ever before. This chapter will provide an overview of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care, identify root causes, and provide key recommendations to address these disparities at both the clinical and health system levels.
NATURE AND EXTENT OF DISPARITIES
Life expectancy at birth is an important measure of the health of a nation’s population. Although the overall life expectancy in the United States has been increasing since 1900, differences due to race/ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status have persisted. For example, at every level of education and income, African Americans have lower life expectancy at age 25 than whites and Hispanics/Latinos. Blacks with a college degree or more education have lower life expectancy than whites and Hispanics who graduated from high school. Blacks have had lower life expectancy compared to whites for as long as data have been collected. From 1975 to 2003, the largest difference in life expectancy between blacks and whites was substantial (6.3 years for males and 4.5 years for females) (Fig. 10-1). The gap in life expectancy between the black and white populations decreased by 2.3 years between 1999 and 2013 from 5.9 to 3.6 years (4.4 years for males and 3.0 years for women) (Fig. 10-2).

"INTRODUCTION
Physicians face novel ethical dilemmas that can be perplexing and emotionally draining. For example, telemedicine, artificial intelligence, handheld personal devices, and learning health care systems all hold the promise of more coordinated and comprehensive care, but also raise concerns about confidentiality, the doctor–patient relationship, and responsibility. This chapter presents approaches and principles that physicians can use to address important vexing ethical issues they encounter in their work. Physicians make ethical judgments about clinical situations every day. They should prepare for lifelong learning about ethical issues so they can respond appropriately. Traditional professional codes and ethical principles provide instructive guidance for physicians but need to be interpreted and applied to each situation. When facing or struggling with a challenging ethical issue, physicians may need to reevaluate their basic convictions, tolerate uncertainty, and maintain their integrity while respecting the opinions of others. Physicians should articulate their concerns and reasoning, discuss and listen to the views of others involved in the case, and utilize available resources, including other health care team members, palliative care, social work, and spiritual care. Moreover, ethics consultation services or a hospital ethics committee can help to clarify issues and identify strategies for resolution, including improving communication and dealing with strong or conflicting emotions. Through these efforts, physicians can gain deeper insight into the ethical issues they face and usually reach mutually acceptable resolutions to complex problems.
APPROACHES TO ETHICAL PROBLEMS
Several approaches are useful for resolving ethical issues, including approaches based on ethical principles, virtue ethics, professional oaths, and personal values. These various sources of guidance may seem to conflict in a particular case, leaving the physician in a quandary. In a diverse society, different individuals may turn to different sources of moral guidance. In addition, general moral precepts often need to be interpreted and applied to a particular clinical situation.
ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
Ethical principles can serve as general guidelines to help physicians determine the right thing to do.
Respecting Patients
Physicians should always treat patients with respect, which entails understanding patients’ goals, providing information, communicating effectively, obtaining informed and voluntary consent, respecting informed refusals, and protecting confidentiality. Different clinical goals and approaches are often feasible, and interventions can result in both benefit and harm. Individuals differ in how they value health and medical care and how they weigh the benefits and risks of medical interventions. Generally, physicians should respect patients’ values and informed choices. Treating patients with respect is especially important when patients are responding to experiences of, or fears about, disrespect and discrimination.
GOALS AND TREATMENT DECISIONS
Physicians should provide relevant and accurate information for patients about diagnoses, current clinical circumstances, expected future course, prognosis, treatment options, and uncertainties, and discuss patients’ goals of care. Physicians may be tempted to withhold a serious diagnosis, ..."
"EPIDEMIOLOGY
CAUSES OF DEATH
In 2019, 2,854,838 individuals died in the United States (Table 12-1). Approximately 74% of these deaths occurred in those aged ≥65 years. The epidemiology of death has changed significantly since 1900 and even since 1980. In 1900, heart disease caused ~8% of all deaths, and cancer accounted for <4% of all deaths. In 1980, heart disease accounted for 38.2% of all deaths, cancer 20.9%, and cerebrovascular disease 8.6% of all deaths. By 2019, there had been a dramatic drop in deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In 2019, 23.1% of all deaths were from cardiovascular disease and just 5.3% from cerebrovascular disease. Deaths attributable to cancer, however, had increased slightly to 21.0%. The proportions of deaths due to chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and suicide have increased. Interestingly, in 2019, HIV/AIDS accounted for <0.18% of all U.S. deaths. While unlikely to continue being a leading cause of death in the future, COVID-19 was also the cause for >600,000 deaths in 2020–2021, and the official figure is almost certainly an undercount of the actual death toll.

This change in the epidemiology of death is also reflected in the costs of illness. In the United States, ~84% of all health care spending goes to patients with chronic illnesses, and 12% of total personal health care spending—slightly less than $400 billion in 2015—goes to the 0.83% of the population in the last year of their lives.
In upper-middle- and upper-income countries, an estimated 70% of all deaths are preceded by a disease or condition, making it reasonable to plan for dying in ..."
